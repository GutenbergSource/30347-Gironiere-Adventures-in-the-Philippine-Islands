<HTML><BODY>A French naval surgeon lived in the Philippines (In the town of Jala-Jala in what is today the province of Rizal, not far from Manila) from 1819 to 1839. In this book, he describes his live in the islands. During this time, he married a local widow, and survived a number of interesting events, including numerous encounters with bandits and a visit to the Tinguian. A very valuable work, as few first hand reports of live in the Philippines in that age are available. Translated from the French, as a result, the representations of Tagalog follow French spelling conventions.
